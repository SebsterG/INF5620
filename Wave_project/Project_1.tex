\section*{}
In this project we use the linear, two-dimensional wave equation:
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + b \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial }{\partial x}(q(x,y)u(x,y,t)) + \frac{\partial }{\partial y}(q(x,y)u(x,y,t))  $$
Our general scheme for internal points is:
$$K = \frac{\Delta t*b}{2}$$

$$u_{i,j}^{n+1} = \frac{K-1}{K+1}u_{i,j}^{n-1} + (\frac{2}{1+K})*u_{i,j}^n $$
$$0.5(\frac{\frac{\Delta t^2}{\Delta x^2}}{K+1}(q_{i+1,j}+q_{i,j})(u_{i+1,j}^n-u_i^n) - (q_{i,j}+q_{i-1,j})(u_{i,j}^n - u_{i+1,j}^n)) + $$ 
$$0.5(\frac{\frac{\Delta t^2}{\Delta y^2}}{K+1}(q_{i,j+1}+q_{j})(u_{i,(j+1)}^n-u_{i,j}^n) - (q_{i,j}+q_{i,j-1})(u_{i,j}^n - u_{i,j+1}^n)) +f_{i,j}^n $$
I have used ghost points so i only need to update the ghost point at each edge with the line in from the edge. Where 0 and N are the ghost points in each respective end.

\begin{align*}
u_{i,0} &= u_{i,2} \\
u_{i,N} &= u_{i,N-2} \\
u_{0,j} &= u_{2,j} \\
u_{N,j} &= u_{N-2,j}    
\end{align*}


Since we have a second order equation, we need to calculate the first time step using $ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 0 @ t = 0 $
By using this with a centred difference we get: $ u_{i,j}^{-1} = u_{i,j}^1 - 2 \delta tV   $
This can be put in to our scheme giving the first step scheme:
$$u_{i,j}^{1} =  u_{i,j}^0 + dt*V(2+ delta tb) $$
$$\frac{\Delta x^2}{4 \Delta t^2 }((q_{i+1,j}+q_{i,j})(u_{i+1,j}^0-u_i^0) - (q_{i,j}+q_{i-1,j})(u_{i,j}^0 - u_{i+1,j}^0)) + $$ 
$$\frac{\Delta y^2}{4 \Delta t^2 }((q_{i,j+1}+q_{j})(u_{i,(j+1)}^0-u_{i,j}^0) - (q_{i,j}+q_{i,j-1})(u_{i,j}^0 - u_{i,j+1}^0)) +\frac{1}{2}f_{i,j}^n $$
Using the the same approach as above with the ghost points.

\subsection*{3.1 Constant Solution}
Here I have used the constant solution of $u = 2 $, as we see from the print out of the error, the numerical solution is correct:
we see that we need f to be zero.

When changing V to be non zero, we get errors in the solver.

\subsection*{3.4}
Here I have inserted the exact solution into the pde, to get $\omega = \sqrt{q*(k_x^2+k_y^2))}$.
In the gif standing wave, I have plotted the numerical and exact solution on top of eachother, and as we can see there is no difference so this tells me that the solver is accurate.

The convergence rate: ..

As we can see the convergence tends toward 2 which again assures 
me that the solver is correct.

\section*{4}

In this section I have modelled different ocean floors and look at how it effects the wave. I have used more or less the same wave for every run.
The first one is a simulation of a beach, found in $beach_1.gif$  
\includemovie{1cm}{1cm}{beach_1.gif}
The red is the seafloor and the blue is the wave. We see that it acts the way we would expect a wave to hit a beach. It increases in amplitude as it hits the beach and gets pulled down a bit as it moves out.
The next simulation was of a wide ridge in the middle of the domain,$ ridge_1.gif$. We see that the wave gets pulled down a bit from ocean floor, as expected. Now we see in $ridge_2.gif$, that when we increase the height of the ridge and increase the amplitude we get some errors in the solution. Its not too bad, but it indicates at what capacity our solver starts making errors.
In the $peak_smooth.gif$ with a little dampning, the effects look natural and we get a pull from the geometry on the wave when it moves over.
With the $peak_crash.gif$ we see a that if we choose a peak thats too high the solver crashes.
In the $rough_mesh.gif$, and $super_rough_mesh.gif$ we see that the solver delivers a good solution even with a coarse mesh.
